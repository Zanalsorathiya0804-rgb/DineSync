DineSync: Real-Time Restaurant Management System
DineSync is an innovative real-time restaurant management system designed for restaurants and their customers. This web application provides an easy-to-use platform for both restaurant staff and customers, built using React, JavaScript, and CSS.

Restaurant Staff: Can easily manage restaurant details, live menus, available tables, and pre-order food for customers.

Customers: Can view restaurant details, browse the live menu, book tables in real-time, and even pre-order food to minimize wait times.

Problem Statement
Running a restaurant efficiently requires managing multiple aspects such as live menu updates, table availability, and customer orders. This often results in:

Unpredictable wait times: Customers often have to wait long before they can get a table or their food.

Menu confusion: Customers may not be aware of what’s currently available.

Overcrowding or inefficient table management: Uncoordinated table bookings lead to chaos during peak hours.

Pre-ordering food: Lack of an easy way for customers to pre-order food means they often wait longer after sitting down.

The Solution
DineSync solves these problems by providing a real-time interface for both restaurant staff and customers:

Restaurant Management: The restaurant staff can easily update the restaurant’s details, menu, and table availability.

Live Menu: The restaurant’s menu is updated in real-time for both staff and customers.

Table Availability: Customers can see available tables and book them instantly.

Pre-ordering Food: Customers can pre-order their meals before arriving to avoid long wait times.
